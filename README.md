## üß† Model Architecture

The project uses the **Xception** model, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is highly efficient for image classification tasks.

### Key Components:
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 299x299 pixels and rescaled to normalize the pixel values.
- **Base Model**: Xception, pre-trained on ImageNet, is used with the top layers removed and custom dense layers added for classification.
- **Classifier**: Custom dense layers with ReLU activation followed by a softmax layer for multi-class classification.

### Training Performance:
- **Epochs**: 30
- **Final Accuracy**: 97.60% on the validation set
- **Test Accuracy**: 99.52%
- **Final Loss**: 0.0287 on test data
